<h2>history</h2>
<p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[4] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[5]</p>
<h3>HTML version timeline</h3>
<h4>HTML 2</h4>
<p>HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:
November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)
May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)
August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)
January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)</p>
<h4>HTML3</h4>
<p>HTML 3.2[16] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version 
    developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[17]
Initially code-named "Wilbur",[18] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entir
reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual
 markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a
  mutual agreement between the two companies.[14] A markup for mathematical formulas similar 
  to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML</p>
